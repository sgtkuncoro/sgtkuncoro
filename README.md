### Hi there 👋

<p align="left">
I'm Sigit Kuncoro, a Web Development Engineer with a passion for building robust and intuitive web solutions. With extensive experience across the stack, I develop and manage scalable applications using modern technologies like React, Vue, and Node.js, alongside various SQL and NoSQL databases. I thrive in collaborative, cross-functional environments, and I am dedicated to delivering exceptional and innovative products.

Currently, I am enthusiastically exploring and experimenting with the implementation of AI and Large Language  Models (LLMs), focusing on their practical applications and real-world capabilities.
